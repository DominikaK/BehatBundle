## Object Management


*EzSystemsBehatBundle* implements the necessary object management functions (as well as respective sentence definitions),
responsible of ensuring that any objects that need to be tested will exist (or not exist).


### Testing
In order to test object management features, you can refer to the feature files in [Features](../Features).
It is possible to test these features by executing the following command, from eZ Publish root:

```
bin/behat -c vendor/ezsystems/behatbundle/EzSystems/BehatBundle/behat.yml
```
